I’m in my own bed. My own bed. This is unreal. First day in Porto, Portugal and it was a blast. This is my new home as a nomad. I think this could be an incredible summer. I’m with a great crew of people in Hacker Paradise (http://hackerparadise.org/). I’ll write more about the program and the things I’m working on this summer in later blog posts. Also, what a great town to spend a summer in. I practically have my own private apartment within a mansion that the group is renting using Airbnb. It’s 2:42am as I make this first entry, but before going to bed I think I need to go a little further back in time to lay the foundation of the story.

I haven’t always had a bed. In fact, I haven’t had a bed since early November 2015. It’s now June 7, 2016. Over the last 7 months I’ve been sleeping in a variety of areas throughout Chicago. I’ve spent a significant time crashing on friends couches and floors. There were more than a few nights in the Chicago winter spent in the back of my Nissan Xterra. Those were fun nights. Then in March I found two free months of coworking space at a new office in Chicago. Since the office had 24/7 access and showers in the basement, I had found my new home. Nights were spent sleeping under desks in different parts of the office. I got weird in the past few months. I loved every bit of it.

How did my life come to this? Easy answer. I worked in finance and realized that being homeless would be better than being in that industry. My first and only job out of college was trading options at the Chicago Board of Options Exchange. Specifically, I was a market maker for options on the S&P 500. The firm I worked for was roughly a dozen people and shall remain nameless. We as a firm had a decent year in 2014 and were entering the bonus season in December. Just a few days before bonuses were to be paid out, the main partner of the firm placed an incredibly risky bet, a bet that was strongly against the opinion of the rest of the firm. He refused to close out of the trade. On the morning of December 19, 2014, the entire account value — many millions of dollars — evaporated in less than one second at 8:30am CST.

That might have been the happiest moment of my life. At that moment I knew that I was no longer tied to a job I hate. I was no longer tied to a life that I hate. I was no longer going to have to face the decision to quit after being handed over a material sum of money when bonuses were paid out. I was free. The following Monday, December 22, I officially quit and began a new journey in my life. I instantly went from miserable to happy. The walk down the stairs to grab my bike at 440 S. LaSalle was pure joy. I rarely take a selfie, but this was a special occasion.

Since that day, I’ve lived an entirely different life. I started from scratch and began asking questions. What does it mean to live a meaningful life? How do you fully experience the life you live? I started adding little habits to my days. It started with journaling and reading, then I added meditating, yoga, and many more. These small habits have amounted to huge changes. I’m an entirely different person than when I quit.

In this blog, I’ll lay out the story of how I evolved into an incredibly happy person. I’ll talk about the habits I’ve formed and the tools I’ve used to help me along my journey. I’ll talk about how I make ends meet financially without being an employee or having a job; a solution that also gives me enough freedom to travel the world. I also try to go to bed smarter every day. My mindset is constantly growing and I’d love to share that growth with you. I’ll share snippets from my journal. I’ll share the key points I pull out of the books I read and how I try to digest that information into life changing wisdom.

Maybe you haven’t followed the same life path I have. If you haven’t gone from working in finance, to homeless, to nomadic, you might still be able to relate to working in a job that you hate and not understanding why you’re still doing it. I’m not encouraging everyone to quit their job and to chase happiness, but I am encouraging everyone to start living your own life. It doesn’t require a dramatic change overnight. You can slowly add habits that will have have a profound effect on your life. My hope is that you’ll be a little closer to finding a happy and fulfilling life by following this blog. At the very least you might find my life to be entertaining.
